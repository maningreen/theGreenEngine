# engine game thingy

this is a game engine i have written by hand and for hand /shrug

# required packages


# build process (make)

assuming you have all the required packages (those being)
* g++/gcc
* make

execute

`make all`

and to run

`./build/engine`

# build process (nix flakes)

this is a lot easier if you have nix

you need nix flakes enabled then do a little

`nix build`
to build

and
`nix run`
to run
